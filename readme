# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis  

This project is a data analysis exercise using hotel booking and price datasets for five major Indian cities — **Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai** — plus a public dataset from Kaggle.  

The goal is to explore how hotel prices vary by city and star rating, check which cities are the busiest based on customer reviews, and visualize different price and demand patterns.

4. **Visual Insights**  
   - **Bar Chart:** Average price by star rating per city

   - **Histogram:** Price distribution of hotels in each city  
   - **Boxplot:** Spread of hotel prices by city
